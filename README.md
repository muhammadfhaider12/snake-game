# Snake Game  
This is a classic Snake game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that moves across the screen, eating food to grow in size while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own body. The player controls the snake's direction using arrow keys, and the score increases with each piece of food consumed.

## Features:  
**Snake Movement:** Controlled using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).  
**Food Generation:** Randomized food spawning at different screen positions.  
**Scorecard:** Tracks the player's score, increasing as the snake eats food.  
**Game Over Condition:** The game ends if the snake hits the wall or its own body.  
**Modular Design:** Separated classes for Snake, Food, and Scorecard for clean and scalable code.
